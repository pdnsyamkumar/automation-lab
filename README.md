# Playwright Setup Guide

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end testing of web applications.

## 📦 Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (v16+ recommended)
- A terminal or shell (e.g., Bash, PowerShell, etc.)

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Initialize a Node.js Project

```bash
npm init -y
```

### 2. Install Playwright with Test Runner

```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test
```

### 3. Install Browsers

Playwright requires Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit for cross-browser testing.

```bash
npx playwright install
```

### 4. Optional: Generate Example Tests

You can scaffold Playwright’s default project structure:

```bash
npx playwright test --init
```

This will create:

- `playwright.config.ts`
- `tests/example.spec.ts`
- `.github` for CI integration (optional)

### 5. Run Your First Test

```bash
npx playwright test
```

Let me know if you'd like a version tailored for JavaScript instead of TypeScript, or if you want to add custom config options (e.g., headless mode, reporters, etc.).
